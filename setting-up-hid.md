Setting up HID for your KaliPixel is pretty straight forward. The official documentation for the HID feature in NetHunter is not is not explained well so I will go through in detail on how to activate and check your HID status.

Navigate to the USB Arsenal in the menu.

#### Click on USB Function and select 'hid' from the drop-down menu. When you do, the ADB section will auto-populate and say 'Enable'. Now select the 'SET USB FUNCTION' button.
