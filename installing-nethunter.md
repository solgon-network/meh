Click on install from storage then navigate to the Kali NetHunter Image we downloaded earlier and select it.

After Magisk copies the zip to the temp directory it will begin the installation process.

### Grab Some Tea...

In conjunction with installing the main NetHunter applications, using this method Magisk also installs the complete Kali file system.  This part of the process could take up to 25 minutes but all my successful installs have been under 10 minutes.
