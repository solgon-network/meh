# Installing Root

Rooting your Pixel device is simpler now that we have installed the custom recovery.&#x20;

From inside the custom recovery click install and navigate to the Magisk.apk [we just downloaded.](magisk.md)

Swipe to install Magisk, then reboot.

After rebooting when you click on the Magisk App it will ask to set a couple permissions, then it will automatically restart your device.&#x20;

After your device boots open up Magisk again and confirm you are running the latest version. At the time of this writing it is [Magisk version 24.1](magisk.md)

### Your Pixel Device Is Now Rooted With A Custom Recovery!
